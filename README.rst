Hebrew Wordnet
==============

This is just a mirror of `the version of the Hebrew Wordnet found on Shuly Wintner's website <http://cl.haifa.ac.il/projects/mwn/index.shtml>`_.


Project description
-------------------

**Objective:** To create a Hebrew WordNet, aligned with the Princeton English WordNet.
**Researchers:** In Haifa, Noam Ordan, Iris Eyal and Shuly Wintner (and, in the past, Margalit Zabludowski). This project is joint with a team at the TCC Division ITC-IRST, Trento, Italy.
**Status:** Complete
**Funding:** Israeli Ministry of Science and Technology, as part of the Knowledge Center for Hebrew Language Telecommunication


Abstract
--------

WordNet is an online lexical reference system whose design is inspired by current psycholinguistic theories of human lexical memory. English nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are organized into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexical concept. Different relations link the synonym sets. For more information, consult the web site or this good introductory paper.
Following the success of the English WordNet, similar networks have been developed for a variety of languages. In particular, researchers at ITC-IRST in Trento, Italy have developed a methodology for parallel development of multilingual WordNets. The system, called MultiWordNet, contains information on several aspects of multilingual dictionaries, including lexical relationships between words, semantic relations over lexical concepts, several mappings of lexical concepts in different languages etc. See this paper for more information on the methodology.

MultiWordNet has a variety of applications, including:

Information retrieval: lexical relations can significantly improve the performance of query answering systems, for example; multilingual relationships facilitate multilingual information extraction and retrieval.
Semantic annotation: since words in the network are tagged by the semantic concepts to which to relate, a multilingual WordNet can be used for semantic annotation and classification of texts.
Disambiguation: semantic relationships can assist in determining the semantic distance between words and concepts, thereby assisting in lexical disambiguation.
Terminology: the system can be used for developing structured terminologies for specific applications.
Our goal in this project is to use the MultiWordNet methodology in order to construct a Hebrew WordNet, aligned with the one developed at IRST (and, therefore, aligned with English, Italian and Spanish).
